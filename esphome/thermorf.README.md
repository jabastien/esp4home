# ThermoRF

This device is a combination of [euroster3000tx](https://github.com/rp3tya/esp4home/blob/master/esphome/euroster3000tx.README.md) and [hckk04](https://github.com/rp3tya/esp4home/blob/master/esphome/hckk04.README.md). By adding an RF receiver to the thermostat, its temperature sensor can be selected during operation (as if the thermostat itself was moved to a different room).
