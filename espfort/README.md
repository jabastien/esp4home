This is a simple pair of ESP nodes, one controlling a relay, the other reading a sensor. The main idea was to have a standalone wireless network of sensors and switches that can work together to implement a thermostat or an alarm system. This proof of concept is made of a binary sensor, which takes the value of the switch from the other node. Instead of a binary sensor one could use a template switch, of course. Or add a temperature sensor and toggle the remote switch, etc.
